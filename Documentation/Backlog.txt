Week 1
	- Parse MIDI file, show data
	- Determine notes and lengths for data
		- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3850688/reading-midi-files-in-java
		- http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/overview-MIDI.html
			- Tracks are individual instruments
			- ShortMessages are most common MIDImessages, on/off's contain status byte followed
				by at most 2 data bytes
			- MetaData messages contain limited amount of metadata, not always avalible.
			- More notes taken, see journal
	- Show working code toward machine learning
		- Downloaded and watched first 50 mins of machine learning course from StandFord University
			- Took notes on supervised learning and regression problems
	- Playback?
Week 2
	- Machine Learning Research
		- Took more notes on Standford Machine Learning Course (see notebook)
		- Ideas for simple Machine learning
		- Detecting scales of one instrument midi, picking out key
	- Music Theory Research
	- Create Learning Model
Week 3
	- Machine Learning
		- Scale Detector Working
			- Buggy comparisons(small fix)-------- FIXED!
			- Compares notes based on octave(vertical) and the notes themselves
		- Need new method to compare artist to one another.
			- Possible DB backend required
			- Figure out how music eras sound and to pick them out.
Week 4
	- Note Duration
		- Midi notes contain bytes for the duration of a note
			- Based on the bpm of the midi
		- Method Header also contains a ppqn(pulse per quarter note)
		- Found vague formula to obtain the duration of a MIDI note
		- Obtained BPM of track
		- Associating Ticks with lengths of microseconds
Week 5
-----------ToDo Tasks:
		- Find way to quantify data
		- Get an idea for the data that can be used for machine learning
-----------Completed:
		- Note durations
		- Make head way on Machine learning
-----------Notes:
		- Data that can be obtained
			- BPM
			- Count of certain notes
			- Range of notes(aka the highest and lowest notes)
			- List of scales that are present
			- Average duration of a note played
			- Total song length
			- Number of ticks per quarter note (may be unrelated)
			- Most frequent high note
			- Most frequent low note
-----------Next Week Task:
		- Find a realistic model to use linar regression on
		- Learn linear regression, example algorithm/program

NEXT WEEK: Linear Regression stuff

Week 6 

-----------ToDo Tasks:
		- Start Linear Regression Algorithm to determine era
		- Have small prediction
-----------Completed:
		- Added more data values
		- Create data object to hold all of song data
-----------Notes:
		- Made a training set for algorithm:
			- Includes major songs from key eras
		- Based on training give a hypothesis for determining era.
-----------Next Week Task:
		- Learn linear regression, example algorithm/program
		- Make Prediction of era, improve accuracy
